              greeting: "Hi, I'm Ihar (Igor) Ausiany. I've been teaching English and German for over [YEARS] years, and along the way I've also learned languages myself — Farsi, Polish, French, and even a bit of Chinese. I mention this because I truly know the ups and downs of language learning from the inside.",
      certifications: "I'm CELTA-certified and currently preparing for the DELTA Cambridge exams. I hold three language-focused university diplomas, the most recent from SWPS University in English Studies (Teaching track).",
      experience: "Beyond the classroom, I'm a passionate traveller — I've visited 50 countries so far. These experiences have shown me how language really works in practice. That's why my lessons are practical, friendly, and tailored to you — built around real-life situations, clear structure, kind feedback, and your personal goals."
